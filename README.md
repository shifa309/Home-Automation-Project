# Home-Automation-Project
IOT project with sensors and leds.

                               Home Automation System
This Project interfaces some of sensors for IOT application also known as Home automation.

Sensors include:

1. Humidity-Temperature Sensor -- DHT 11 : Digital sensor for sensing temperature and humidity.
2. Water Level Sensor : Detect the presence of water and, when placed in locations where water should not be present, a leak. 
    The resistance is inversely proportional to the height of the water. The sensor produces an output voltage according to the resistance, which by measuring we can determine the water level.
3. Ultrasonic Sensor -- HCSR04: It work by emitting sound waves. They then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the time required.
4. Light Dependent Resistor â€“ LDR : Component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This resistor works on the principle of photo conductivity.
5. Radio Frequency Identification -- RFID : The protocol followed by it is SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)-commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals such as shift registers, sensors.
(Note: RFID is implemented throught Arduino microprocessor)



Note: The above files here include .ino files separate for each sensor, with web server and then combined sensors code. 
      You just need to pass network credentials (ssid, password) according to the wifi you are using.
